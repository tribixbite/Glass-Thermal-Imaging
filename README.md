*Real-time thermal imaging on Google Glass with FLIR Boson camera*

## üî• Features

### Real Thermal Processing
- **Live Y16 Raw Data**: Direct 16-bit thermal data extraction from FLIR Boson cameras
- **Improved Temperature Estimation**: Uses T-Linear format conversion (centi-Kelvin based)
- **Multi-Resolution Support**: Compatible with Boson 640x512 and 320x256 models
- **Real-Time Visualization**: Live thermal data with minimal latency

### Advanced Thermal Visualization
- **Multiple Color Palettes**: Iron (heat signature), Rainbow (full spectrum), and Grayscale modes
- **Center Crosshair**: Visual reticle showing measurement point
- **Thermal Overlay**: Real-time false-color thermal imaging over camera view
- **Glass-Optimized Display**: 640x360 resolution optimized for Glass prism display

### Glass Gesture Controls
- **Single Tap**: Measure center point temperature (3-second display with ~ indicator)
- **Double Tap**: Toggle thermal modes and cycle color palettes
- **Swipe Down**: Capture both visual and radiometric data (FIXED: was detecting up)
- **Visual Feedback**: Status updates and temperature readings via Glass display

### Enhanced Data Capture
- **Dual Format Saving**: Visual images (.jpg) + Raw thermal data (.raw)
- **Metadata Export**: Timestamps, temperature readings, format specifications
- **Organized Storage**: Files saved to `/flir-boson/` directory with descriptive names
- **Scientific Analysis**: Raw Y16 data preserved for post-processing

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Temperature Accuracy

**IMPORTANT:** This application currently uses raw thermal data (Y16) over UVC interface. Temperature values displayed are **estimates** based on T-Linear format conversion and are **not radiometrically calibrated**.

For accurate temperature measurements, FLIR Boson requires specific calibration commands sent over a serial interface (SDK integration). This is planned for future releases. Current temperature readings should be used for:
- **Relative analysis** (identifying hot/cold spots)
- **Thermal pattern recognition**
- **Comparative temperature measurements**

**Not recommended for:** Absolute quantitative measurements, medical applications, or precision industrial use.

## üîß Hardware Requirements

- Try different high-quality USB OTG adapters

### Build Failures
**Symptom**: Gradle build errors
**Solutions**:
- Ensure Java 17 is installed: `java -version`
- Verify AAPT2 path: `ls tools/aapt2` (should exist and be executable)
- Check Android SDK: Ensure API 19 (KitKat) is installed
- Clean build cache: `./gradlew clean`

### Thermal Display Issues
**Symptom**: Poor thermal image quality or no thermal overlay
**Solutions**:
- Verify camera supports Y16 format (check camera specifications)
- Ensure adequate scene temperature variation for contrast
- Try different thermal color palettes (double-tap to cycle)
- Check thermal data buffer size in logs

### Glass Performance Issues
**Symptom**: App lag or crashes on Glass
**Solutions**:
- Close other Glass applications to free memory

How to compile library  
=========
The Gradle build system will build the entire project, including the NDK parts. If you want to build with Gradle build system,

1. make directory on your favorite place (this directory is parent directory of `UVCCamera` project).
2. change directory into the directory.
3. clone this repository with `git  clone https://github.com/saki4510t/UVCCamera.git`
4. change directory into `UVCCamera` directory with `cd UVCCamera`
5. build library with all sample projects using `gradle build`

It will takes several minutes to build. Now you can see apks in each `{sample project}/build/outputs/apks` directory.  
Or if you want to install and try all sample projects on your device, run `gradle installDebug`.  

Note: Just make sure that `local.properties` contains the paths for `sdk.dir` and `ndk.dir`. Or you can set them as enviroment variables of you shell. On some system, you may need add `JAVA_HOME` envairoment valiable that points to JDK directory.  

If you want to use Android Studio(unfortunately NDK supporting on Android Studio is very poor though),
1. make directory on your favorite place (this directory is parent directory of `UVCCamera` project).
2. change directory into the directory.
3. clone this repository with `git  clone https://github.com/saki4510t/UVCCamera.git`
4. start Android Studio and open the cloned repository using `Open an existing Android Studio project`
5. Android Studio raise some errors but just ignore now. Android Studio generate `local.properties` file. Please open `local.properties` and add `ndk.dir` key to the end of the file. The contents of the file looks like this.
```
sdk.dir={path to Android SDK on your storage}
ndk.dir={path to Android SDK on your storage}
```
Please replace actual path to SDK and NDK on your storage.  
Of course you can make `local.properties` by manually instead of using automatically generated ones by Android Studio.
6. Synchronize project
7. execute `Make project` from `Build` menu.

If you want to use build-in VCS on Android Studio, use `Check out project from Version Control` from `https://github.com/saki4510t/UVCCamera.git`. After cloning, Android Studio ask you open the project but don't open now. Instead open the project using `Open an existing Android Studio project`. Other procedures are same as above.

If you still need to use Eclipse or if you don't want to use Gradle with some reason, you can build suing `ndk-build` command.

1. make directory on your favorite place.
2. change directory into the directory.
3. clone this repository with `git  clone https://github.com/saki4510t/UVCCamera.git`
4. change directory into `{UVCCamera}/libuvccamera/build/src/main/jni` directory.
5. run `ndk-build`
6. resulted shared libraries are available under `{UVCCamera}/libuvccamera/build/src/main/libs` directory and copy them into your project with directories by manually.
7. copy files under `{UVCCamera}/libuvccamera/build/src/main/java` into your project source directory by manually.

How to use
=========
Please see sample project and/or our web site(but sorry web site is Japanese only).
These sample projects are IntelliJ projects, as is the library.
This library works on at least Android 3.1 or later(API >= 12), but Android 4.0(API >= 14)
or later is better. USB host function must be required.
If you want to try on Android 3.1, you will need some modification(need to remove
setPreviewTexture method in UVCCamera.java etc.), but we have not confirm whether the sample
project run on Android 3.1 yet.
Some sample projects need API>=18 though.

###2014/07/25
Add some modification to the library and new sample project named "USBCameraTest2".
This new sample project demonstrate how to capture movie using frame data from
UVC camera with MediaCodec and MediaMuxer.
New sample requires at least Android 4.3(API>=18).
This limitation does not come from the library itself but from the limitation of
MediaMuxer and MediaCodec#createInputSurface.

###2014/09/01
Add new sample project named `USBCameraTest3`
This new sample project demonstrate how to capture audio and movie simultaneously
using frame data from UVC camera and internal mic with MediaCodec and MediaMuxer.
This new sample includes still image capturing as png file.(you can easily change to
save as jpeg) This sample also requires at least Android 4.3(API>=18).
This limitation does not come from the library itself but from the limitation of
MediaMuxer and MediaCodec#createInputSurface.

###2014/11/16
Add new sample project named `USBCameraTest4`
This new sample project mainly demonstrate how to use offscreen rendering
and record movie without any display.
