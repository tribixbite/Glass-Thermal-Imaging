# Google Glass Thermal Camera App TODO List

This document outlines the tasks required to successfully build the UVC-Boson project into a functional thermal imaging application for Google Glass XE.

## Phase 1: Core Functionality & Build Fixes

These are the essential tasks to get a basic version of the app building and running.

- [x] **Enable and Verify NDK Build:**
    - In `libuvccamera/build.gradle`, re-enable the `ndkBuild` task.
    - This is critical for compiling the JNI code that communicates with the USB camera.
    - **Action:** Uncomment the `dependsOn ndkBuild` and `dependsOn ndkClean` lines.
    - **Verify:** Ensure you have the Android NDK installed and the `ndk.dir` property is correctly set in your `local.properties` file.

- [x] **Implement GDK Voice Trigger:**
    - Allow the app to be launched with a voice command (e.g., "Okay Glass, start thermal camera").
    - **Action:**
        1. Modify `usbCameraTest3/src/main/AndroidManifest.xml` to add the `VOICE_TRIGGER` intent filter to the `MainActivity`.
        2. Create a `res/xml/voice_trigger.xml` file in `usbCameraTest3` to define the keyword.

- [x] **Integrate GDK Gesture Detector:**
    - Replace the standard `android.view.GestureDetector` with the `com.google.android.glass.touchpad.GestureDetector`.
    - This ensures reliable handling of Glass-specific gestures.
    - **Action:**
        1. Update `MainActivity.java` to use the GDK `GestureDetector`.
        2. Map gestures to actions:
            - `TAP`: Toggle settings menu (once created).
            - `TWO_TAP`: Take a picture.
            - `SWIPE_RIGHT` / `SWIPE_LEFT`: Navigate settings menu.
            - `SWIPE_DOWN`: Exit the application (`finish()`).

- [x] **Add GPS Location Permission and Implementation:**
    - Add GPS metadata to captured images and videos.
    - **Action:**
        1. Add the `ACCESS_FINE_LOCATION` permission to `AndroidManifest.xml`.
        2. In `MainActivity.java`, implement `LocationManager` to get the current GPS coordinates.
        3. Update `saveRadiometricData()` to include GPS coordinates in the metadata file.

## Phase 2: Feature Implementation

With the core app running, these tasks add the required features.

- [x] **Implement Video Recording:**
    - Add the ability to record video from the thermal camera.
    - **Action:**
        1. In `MainActivity.java`, add a method `startRecording()` and `stopRecording()`.
        2. Use the `mUVCCamera.startCapture()` and `mUVCCamera.stopCapture()` methods.
        3. Add a gesture or menu item to trigger recording.
        4. Save the video file to the capture directory, including metadata.

- [x] **Create a Glass-Style Settings Menu:**
    - Create a menu for changing settings, navigable with swipe gestures.
    - **Action:**
        1. Create a `MenuActivity.java` that is launched from `MainActivity`.
        2. Use the GDK `CardScrollView` and a `CardScrollAdapter` to create a list of settings.
        3. Implement menu items for:
            - Toggling thermal mode.
            - Cycling through color palettes.
            - Toggling GPS metadata.
            - Starting/stopping video recording.

- [x] **Implement a Live Card:**
    - Show the status of the camera on the Glass timeline when the app is not in the foreground.
    - **Action:**
        1. Create a `LiveCardService.java` that extends `Service`.
        2. Use the `LiveCard` API to publish a card.
        3. Update the card to show "Camera Connected" or "Camera Disconnected" based on USB events.
        4. Set the card's action to open the `MainActivity`.
